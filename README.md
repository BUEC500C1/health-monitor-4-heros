The Artificial Intelligence API is to analize the output data, which should be stored in a json file from our data computation API, then give label-classified result. According to the information of each clients, we give medical suggestion to them. 

For this part, we decide to implement Google API. The try-catch exception should include methods corresponding to incompleted clients' data.
